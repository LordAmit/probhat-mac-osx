### Probhat Bangla keyboard layout for Mac OSX

This project hosts Probhat keyboard layout configuration for Mac OSX systems.

There are two variations:
- **Probhat (BD)**: BDT symbol (‡ß≥) on <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>
- **Probhat (IN)**: INR symbol (‚Çπ) on <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>

Other than this variation, the layouts are faithful to the scheme published at [ekushey.org][e]<span style="font-size:60%">[üèõ][w]</span>

### NOTES
- The <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Command</kbd> special keys use US QWERTY layouts.
- Some key combinations may conflict with some application-specific shortcuts. For example, <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> toggles block comments by default in VSCode.

### ISSUES
Please [report issues or missing features][s]!
